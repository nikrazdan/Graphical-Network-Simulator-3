# Graphical-Network-Simulator-3


The Paper is based on a very popular network emulation software called Graphical Network
Simulator commonly known as GNS3. The real motivation behind this research is to find and
understand an application that is affordable, functional, educational and provides full extent of
network behavior in virtual environment. I personally being a Network Engineer really wanted to
find a way of having an environment which can help implement actual network device operating
system for testing and understanding its behavior before implementing it in a production
environment.
In this paper I have talked about GNS3 as an application, Why I wanted to use Linux distribution to run GNS3, 
Itâ€™s installation process and the requirements, how to use
this application by creating a small network topology and comparing its performance with
running same application on other OS and also to compare it with real world network device
functionality, Resource usage and optimization, Companies using this application and for what
purposes, Industries where it can potentially be used, Various applications similar to GNS3 and
the differences between them, application data Backup and Restore. Finally, I have ended this
paper with a Bibliography and logs from installation and uninstallation process and router
configuration. I have also provided a list of dependency software for GNS3.
